This script is meant to be used in GitLab CI to automatically open Merge Requests for feature branches, if there is none yet.

The script is provided as dedicated docker image to improve maintainability in the future.

It is based on the script and idea of [Riccardo Padovani](https://rpadovani.com), which he introduced with his blog post [How to automatically create new MR on Gitlab with Gitlab CI](https://rpadovani.com/open-mr-gitlab-ci).
Thanks for providing this.

## Instructions

### 1) `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`
Set a secret variable in your GitLab project with your private token.
Name it `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN`.
This is necessary to raise the Merge Request on your behalf.

### 2) `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
  - openMr
  - otherStages

Open Merge Request:
  image: tmaier/gitlab-auto-merge-request:1
  before_script: [] # We do not need any setup work, let's remove the global one (if any)
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none # We do not need a clone of the GIT repository to create a Merge Request
  stage: openMr
  only:
    - /^feature\/*/ # We have a very strict naming convention
  script:
    - merge-request.sh # The name of the script
```

You can see this in action at [`.gitlab-ci.yml` of this project](.gitlab-ci.yml).

### Additional features

- You can set prefix for your merge request title like "WIP:"

```yaml
  ...

  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
    REMOVE_BRANCH_AFTER_MERGE: true # Remove branch after merge
    COMMIT_PREFIX: WIP # Additional prefix
  ...
```
- If source and target branch is same then merge request will be fail.
